# ðŸŽ¨ New Logo Update Instructions

## Current Status
You've provided a new, cleaner J7 Emporium logo with:
- Clean "J7 EMPORIUM" text in white
- Modern geometric "J7" icon on the left
- Dark green background (#2D5551 or similar)
- Professional, minimalist design

## Steps to Complete Integration

### 1. Save the New Logo
Please save the new logo image as:
```
/home/farooqui/Desktop/j7-emporium/public/assets/images/emporium-logo-new.png
```

**Recommended Specifications:**
- Format: PNG with transparency (if available) or solid background
- Dimensions: Minimum 1200px width for 4K displays
- File size: Under 500KB (optimize if needed)
- Quality: High resolution for Retina displays

### 2. Once Saved, Run This Command
```bash
cd /home/farooqui/Desktop/j7-emporium
ls -lh public/assets/images/emporium-logo-new.png
```

### 3. The Header Will Automatically Update
The code is ready to use the new logo. Once the file is saved, the website will automatically display it with:
- âœ… Large, prominent sizing (up to 92px height)
- âœ… Perfect alignment with navbar
- âœ… Smooth animations and transitions
- âœ… Responsive across all devices
- âœ… Optimized for 4K/Retina displays

## Alternative: Use Current Filename
If you've already saved the logo with a different name, let me know the exact filename and I'll update the Header component immediately.

**Ready to proceed once the logo file is in place!** ðŸš€
